# hello-world
Just getting started

My name is Jelil. I am a graduate teacher from
one of the noble colleges of education in Ghana.
Although I in intend to be a teacher, my primary
goal in life is to be a full time programmer and 
I believed in it than any other profession 
because it will make be a common problem solver
in the society I found myself.
